    "Limbo" is an in-house store run by Blacker House as a means of selling soda
    and assorted snacks at near-cost to its members.  Students select their 
    desired merchandise and then enter their purchases into the Limbo website.
    Caltech's Honor Code permits this store to be unmanned.

    Originally, a small set of sellers actively participated in the market, due to the
    software restrictions of the desktop-based interface.  Accounting was difficult and
    consequently kept multiple sellers from sellling competing products.  A switchover
    to a Web 2.0 interface during the past summer added a one-sided market:  Each product
    carries potentially multiple asking prices.  As more cheaply priced items are sold,
    prices rise accordingly until additional merchandise enters the market.
</p> 
<p> 
    We propose augmenting Limbo to create a two-sided market so buyers are able to indicate
    the prices that they are willing to buy merchandise at.  While common twelve ounce soda
    cans will surely be sold quickly, more rare treats may likely see less turnover.  By
    creating a two-sided market, buyers can indicate their preferences to sellers.  Sellers
    are then guaranteed to clear their stock at a known price (the buyers' bids).

    To use Limbo, enter your name once an account has been registered.  (Registration is
    accomplished by clicking "what? you haven't heard of me?")  Once logged in, pick the
    items desired and the total amount of money deposited.  For users with outstanding options,
    purchases go towards fulfilling their obligations to purchase.
</p> 
<p> 
    In addition to making spot purchases, users can specify options for products in the future
    at the bottom of the page (under "manage options").   Prospective sellers can use listings
    of available options to guage market demand.
